# Stella's personal bot
tbh i only made this bot for myself, but you guys can use it
as it can be for the public but most of the commands are 
specifically for discord.py.


Anyways if you want to run this, i kinda dont have a setup script 
to help you people to run this since i'm extremely lazy. Because
you would need at least 2 bots running, or just remove the 
ipc_client object which will remove the banner generator and
the public repr command. Make sure to make that command
owner only if you do remove it.

After that you would need 2 neural network model hence why im lazy.
Anyways good luck if you do wanna run it yourslef l ol
